# Build request-context Handoff — 2026-05-18 (twenty-seventh session — **PRD #95 slice #98 IMPLEMENTED, MERGED to `main` and pushed; issue #98 CLOSED.**)

## What shipped this session

**Slice #98 — org-scope `contract-templates/[id]` GET and DELETE.** A
Tier-1 cross-tenant data-leak fix of PRD [#95](https://github.com/ericdaniels22/Nookleus/issues/95)
(security triage of the ungated endpoints).

`GET` and `DELETE /api/settings/contract-templates/[id]` omitted the
Active-Organization filter their sibling `PATCH` already applies — any
logged-in user could read, or soft-archive, **another Organization's**
contract template by id. Source commit `700a0fc`, merged `--no-ff` to
`main` as `d1a266b`, pushed; branch `worktree-98-org-scope-contract-templates`
deleted. 3 files, +44/−6:

- **`src/app/api/settings/contract-templates/[id]/route.ts`** — `GET` and
  `DELETE` now filter `.eq("organization_id", ctx.orgId)`, mirroring
  `PATCH`. `DELETE` additionally `.select("id")`s the updated row and
  returns **404** when nothing matched (it previously returned `success`
  unconditionally, even for a no-op update). A template in another
  Organization is now indistinguishable from a missing one — both 404.
- **`src/app/api/settings/contract-templates/[id]/route.test.ts`** (new) —
  6 tests, GET/DELETE × own-org / other-org / missing, using the
  `request-context-fakes.ts` `fakeUserClient` (these routes query the User
  client directly; `contract_templates` seeded via `extraTables`).
- **`docs/request-context-ungated-endpoints.md`** — new `## Triage
  decisions (PRD #95)` section with the `### #98` decision recorded.

This is a **data-scoping correctness fix only** — it adds no permission
gate. Per the #98 spec, the permission *rule* for the settings-area routes
is assigned separately in settings slice #107.

**Verification:** typecheck clean on the changed surface (only the
pre-existing unrelated `sync-folder-incremental.test.ts` `TS2322` remains);
lint zero-new on both changed files; full suite **360 green / 56 files**
(the +6 are this slice's new tests).

## Wrong-worktree detour (worth knowing)

The session opened in the `worktree-103-gate-jobs-files-photos` worktree —
the orientation `git status` snapshot showed it clean, but a **concurrent
agent session** was actively editing that same checkout (in-progress
uncommitted #101/#102/#103 work appeared mid-session, and that worktree's
docs file was reset underneath us). #98 was first implemented there by
mistake. It was then **cleanly extracted**: a fresh `worktree-98-...`
branched off `main`, the 3-file change re-applied there, and the #98 edits
reverted out of the #103 worktree (`route.ts` `git checkout`'d,
`route.test.ts` removed) — the concurrent session's #103 work left
untouched. The merged #98 contains only its own 3 files.

## What's next

With #96 + #97 + #98 + #100 in, **PRD #95 has 8 slices left** (#99,
#101–#107):

- **#100 — gate `settings/users/*`** — **DONE.** Merged to `main` by a
  concurrent session (`e77c4ad`, PR #118 `960d0ae`) while this handoff was
  being written; closed the self-privilege-escalation hole. Its own
  handoff was not yet written at this session's end.
- **#101 — org-scope the four expenses Service-client GETs** — unblocked
  by #97; in-progress in the #103 worktree under the concurrent session.
- **#102 (payments), #103 (jobs files/photos + search)** — in-progress in
  that same concurrent session's #103 worktree.
- **Tier 2 policy mapping:** #99, #104, #105, #107 — all unblocked by #96.
- **#106 — gate the contracts endpoints** — HITL; needs a human decision
  on introducing a contract-area permission key.

## Open threads

- **Concurrent session in the `worktree-103` checkout** — at this session's
  end it held uncommitted #101/#102/#103 work and its full suite was
  red on its own (incomplete) files. Not this session's to land; flagged
  so the next orientation does not mistake it for drift.
- `00-NOW.md` is still bloated — only the stacked `last_verified`
  frontmatter is maintained; a trim is overdue (carried).
- `schema.sql` still stale in general respects (carried).
- Two crew password-reset builds merged to `main` without handoffs
  (carried).
- Still queued, untouched: #58 umbrella has #62 + #63 `ready-for-agent`;
  the #68 real-email demo is on Eric's plate.

## Mechanical state

- **Branch:** `main`
- **Commit at session end:** the `vault: handoff for #98` commit on `main`,
  preceded by `d1a266b` (merge of `worktree-98-org-scope-contract-templates`)
  and `700a0fc` (the #98 source commit)
- **Merge note:** `main` advanced to `960d0ae` (PR #118 / #100) between
  branching `worktree-98` and merging it. The `--no-ff` merge took one
  conflict in `docs/request-context-ungated-endpoints.md` — both #100 and
  #98 appended a subsection under the new `## Triage decisions (PRD #95)`
  header — resolved by keeping both (`### #100` then `### #98`).
- **Verification post-merge:** full suite **377 green / 59 files** on
  merged `main`.
- **Uncommitted changes:** none (untracked `out/` only)
- **Migrations applied this session:** none
- **Deployed to Vercel:** yes — auto-deploy on merge to `main`
