# Nookleus Platform Context

Nookleus is a multi-tenant SaaS for contracting businesses. Every server
request acts on behalf of one user working inside one company; the language
below names the pieces that make that scoping explicit and testable.

## Language

**Organization**:
A tenant — one contracting company. All business data (jobs, contracts,
estimates, invoices) belongs to exactly one Organization.
_Avoid_: tenant, account, company (in code — "company" is fine in UI copy)

**Active Organization**:
The single Organization a request is scoped to, resolved from the
`active_organization_id` claim on the user's access-token JWT. A user may
belong to several Organizations but acts within one at a time.
_Avoid_: current org, selected org

**Request Context**:
The bundle of facts about one authenticated server request — the user, their
Active Organization, their role in it, and a database client. Produced once
per request by the `withRequestContext` wrapper and handed to the route
handler, which never runs unless the request's permission rule passed.
_Avoid_: auth result, session, request scope

**User client**:
A database connection that acts as the logged-in user, with row-level
security enforced — the database itself prevents cross-Organization reads.
_Avoid_: server client, anon client

**Service client**:
A database connection with row-level security bypassed; it can reach every
Organization's data, so the caller is itself responsible for scoping by
Active Organization. Carried by a Request Context only when a route
explicitly opts in.
_Avoid_: admin client, master client

**Email account**:
A connection to an external mailbox (IMAP/SMTP) that Nookleus syncs and
sends mail through. Belongs to exactly one Organization. Comes in two kinds
— a Shared account or a Personal account.
_Avoid_: mailbox, inbox connection

**Shared email account**:
An Email account the whole Organization works from — e.g. a `team@` address
where job-related mail arrives. Every member with email access can read it
and send from it; only admins change its settings or disconnect it.
_Avoid_: company account, org inbox

**Personal email account**:
An Email account owned by one User and content-private to them — only the
owner reads its mail. An admin can see the account is connected and can
disconnect it (e.g. when the owner leaves the company) but cannot read its
messages.
_Avoid_: private inbox, user account

## Relationships

- A **User** belongs to one or more **Organizations**; each membership carries a role.
- A **Request Context** names exactly one **Active Organization**.
- A **Request Context** always carries a **User client**; it carries a **Service client** only when the route opts in.
- An **Email account** belongs to one **Organization**; a **Personal email account** is additionally owned by one **User**, a **Shared email account** by none.

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "When a route asks for a Request Context, does it always get a Service client?"
> **Maintainer:** "No — only the User client by default. The Service client bypasses Organization scoping, so a route has to explicitly opt in, and that opt-in is visible right at the route's declaration."

## Flagged ambiguities

- "auth gate" was used for four near-identical route helpers (`requirePermission`, `requireAdmin`, `requireViewAccounting`, and an inline `requireLogExpenses`) — resolved: these collapse into the one **Request Context** wrapper.
